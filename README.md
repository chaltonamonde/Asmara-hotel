## 🚀 Getting Started

Since the application is built on static web technologies, there are zero compilation steps or framework installations required.

### Viewing the Site
1. **Open Directly**: Double-click `index.html` on any machine to open the website in your browser.
2. **Local Server (Recommended)**: Use a lightweight development server like Live Server (VS Code Extension) or run Python's built-in server in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Seeding Reservations
When opening the **Reservation Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`) for the first time, the system automatically populates the table with demo seed bookings (such as Mark Zuckerberg, Idris Elba) to demonstrate the layout. You can clear or reload the mock data at any time by clicking the **Reset Seed Data** button at the top of the dashboard.

### 🔌 M-Pesa Local Testing & Webhooks (ngrok)
To test M-Pesa Daraja callback webhooks locally, you can use the automated tunnel script:

1. **Install and Authenticate ngrok**:
   Ensure ngrok is installed and authenticated on your local machine:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken <your-auth-token>
   ```
2. **Run the Tunnel Script**:
   Run the following script in your project root folder:
   ```bash
   ./start-mpesa-tunnel.sh
   ```
   *Note: Because free ngrok URLs change on every restart, this script needs to be re-run each development session.*
3. **Restart the Server**:
   The script will automatically detect your local server port, launch ngrok, and update the `MPESA_CALLBACK_URL` in your `.env` file. You must **restart your Express server** afterward so it loads the updated `.env` configuration.
